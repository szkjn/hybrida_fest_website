        "bio": "In recent years Toma Kami has been shaping an eclectic yet recognisable sound with several outings on Bristol's Livity Sound as well as his own imprint mb studio, with the latter being a home to his Speed Oddity releases, also soon to become a party series in 2024 with a first residency at Helsinki’s Post Bar. A specialisation in rhythmic variety partly informed by his dynamic DJ sets, that have become well known synonyms for wild rides through the likes of heavy bass, dancehall, techno, jungle, electro, rap, and any other style that will match his expression of specifically physical and unusual energy on the dance floor. An approach that has seen him tour the likes of USA and Asia, as well as world renowned clubs like De School and Berghain, and regular slots at festivals like Dekmantel. Through his label mb studio, Toma continues to push his own sound and vision as well as fresh music from exciting new producers from the burgeoning French scene and beyond. ",

Currently, Burger is working on several exhibitions scheduled to open throughout 2024 and a public commission in The Hague, Netherlands.",
        "project": "Burger is creating works that seem to look back at their observers, drawing them in with delicate textures and gradients but, at the same moment, almost repulsing them through the harshness of shapes, forms, or colors. His paintings are sediments of meaning derived from countless references, which may seem surreal or illogical initially but generate meaning through an intuitive approach."
