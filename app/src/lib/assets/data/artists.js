        "bio": "As one half of sample twisters SHXCXCHCXSH, SSTROM takes on a more analog approach by manipulating repetitive sequences of hardware. Through the years the soundscape has emerged from a distinct hypnotic minimalism into a vast cinematic and more adventurous wilderness. His works on Voam, Rösten and Semantica are characterised by immersion, intense immediacy and spontaneity.",
        "project": "For the Fest he will get into dynamics of opposites. Sponged up endless reverbs. Congealed liquids. Intense masses of sequencer motifs carved out by compressors and equalisers to bare intimacy. Beats or no beats."

A specialisation in rhythmic variety partly informed by his dynamic DJ sets, that have become well known synonyms for wild rides through the likes of heavy bass, dancehall, techno, jungle, electro, rap, and any other style that will match his expression of specifically physical and unusual energy on the dance floor. An approach that has seen him tour the likes of USA and Asia, as well as world renowned clubs like De School and Berghain, and regular slots at festivals like Dekmantel. Through his label mb studio, Toma continues to push his own sound and vision as well as fresh music from exciting new producers from the burgeoning French scene and beyond. ",
